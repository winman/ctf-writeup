Hi! Are you my master?
yes
So prove it! We have a secret code so we can talk secretly.
I will give you a couple of hints!
If you give me a C, I give you a W.
If you give me a F, I give you a T.
If you give me a Z, I give you a 0(zero).
So, what if I give you an I? What should you give me?
Q
Nice! But this doesnt prove much.
Translate the following and I shall give to you what youre looking for:
QYMFRUMYGFUHKTWQJRUHG
IAMTHEMASTEROFCIPHERS
Hello my master! Here is what you seek: 3DS{M4st3r_My_455}.



steps:
1, guess the key substitute for 'I', one by one, and get 'Q'
2, now we have part of the key: "WT0Q"(cipher) for "CFZI"(plain)
2, run SCBSOLVR, with fixed key, ignore 0/z pair, and manually change to final answer (attached the pic)
